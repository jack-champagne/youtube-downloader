## Youtube Downloader

Youtube downloader is a personal project of mine that is meant to circumvent Youtube's video recommendation algorithm and actually make 'subscribe' mean something.

You choose as many channels as you like, run the download script, and it will download the most recent video from the channel (if it has not been downloaded before)

### Dependencies:
```
pip install --upgrade youtube-dl
```

And that's it! Run the script, feel free to add PRs and issues if you are interested.
